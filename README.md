# CodeLODPluginV1

This plugin contains support for loding of large code systems, including the complete unloading of objects and the definition of loaded objects due to the built tree.

I'm tired of writing project documentation and doing examples. I'm freezing development for now. So keep the code, if you are interested - write me an email sgsggssg1@gmail.com
The comments in the code are duplicated in Russian and English.
